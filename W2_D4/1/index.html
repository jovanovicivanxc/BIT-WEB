        South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the
        south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian
        Oceans;[9][10][11] on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and on the east
        and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland; and surrounds the kingdom of Lesotho.[12] South Africa is the largest
        country in Southern Africa[13] and the 25th-largest country in the world by land area and, with close to 56 million
        people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World
        or the Eastern Hemisphere. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry,[5] divided among
        a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages, nine of which have official status.[11] The remaining
        population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured)
        ancestry.

        South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic
        makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, which is among the highest number
        of any country in the world.[11] Two of these languages are of European origin: Afrikaans developed from Dutch and
        serves as the first language of most white and coloured South Africans; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism,
        and is commonly used in public and commercial life, though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language.[11] The
        country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'Ã©tat, and regular elections have been held for almost
        a century. However, the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994. During the 20th century,
        the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority, with this struggle playing a large
        role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, institutionalising
        previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress and other
        anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in 1990.

        Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's democracy, which comprises
        a parliamentary republic and nine provinces. South Africa is often referred to as the "rainbow nation" to describe
        the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.[14] The World Bank classifies South Africa
        as an upper-middle-income economy, and a newly industrialised country.[15][16] Its economy is the second-largest
        in Africa, and the 34th-largest in the world.[6] In terms of purchasing power parity, South Africa has the seventh-highest
        per capita income in Africa. However, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population
        unemployed and living on less than US$1.25 a day.[17][18] Nevertheless, South Africa has been identified as a middle
        power in international affairs, and maintains significant regional influence.[19][20]
