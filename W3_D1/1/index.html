    <h1 id="top">Brahmaputra</h1>
    <p>
        The Brahmaputra (/ˌbrɑːməˈpuːtrə/ is one of the major rivers of Asia, a trans-boundary river which flows through China, India
        and Bangladesh. As such, it is known by various names in the region: Assamese: ব্ৰহ্মপুত্ৰ নদ ('নদ' nôd, masculine
        form of 'নদী' nôdi "river") Brôhmôputrô [bɹɔɦmɔputɹɔ]; Sanskrit: ब्रह्मपुत्र, IAST: Brahmaputra; Tibetan: ཡར་ཀླུངས་གཙང་པོ་,
        Wylie: yar klung gtsang po Yarlung Tsangpo; simplified Chinese: 布拉马普特拉河; traditional Chinese: 布拉馬普特拉河; pinyin: Bùlāmǎpǔtèlā
        Hé. It is also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra (when referring to the whole river including the stretch within Tibet).[3]
        The Manas River, which runs through Bhutan, joins it at Jogighopa, in India. It is the tenth largest river in the
        world by discharge, and the 15th longest. With its origin in the Angsi glacier, located on the northern side of the
        Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo River,[1] it flows across southern Tibet to break through
        the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh (India).[4]
        It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be
        mistaken with Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Padma, the popular name of the river
        Ganges in Bangladesh, and finally the Meghna and from here it is known as Meghna before emptying into the Bay of
        Bengal.[5]

    <p>About 3,848 km (2,391 mi)[1] long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation. The average
        depth of the river is 38 m (124 ft) and maximum depth is 120 m (380 ft). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding
        in the spring when Himalayas snow melts. The average discharge of the river is about 19,800 m3/s (700,000 cu ft/s),[4]
        and floods can reach over 100,000 m3/s (3,500,000 cu ft/s).[6] It is a classic example of a braided river and is
        highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion.[7] It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit
        a tidal bore. It is navigable for most of its length. The river drains the Himalaya east of the Indo-Nepal border,
        south-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai-Bum
        hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The
        basin, especially south of Tibet, is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only
        peak above 8,000 m, hence is the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin. The Brahmaputra's upper course was long
        unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is
        often called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river. The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent
        have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means "son of Brahma" in Sanskrit (putra means "son").[8]
