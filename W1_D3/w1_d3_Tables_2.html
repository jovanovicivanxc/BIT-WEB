                                <b>Palm Beach</b> is an incorporated town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The
                                Intracoastal Waterway separates it from the neighboring cities of West Palm Beach and Lake
                                Worth. In 2000, Palm Beach had a year-round population of 10,468, with an estimated seasonal
                                population of 30,000.</p>

                                The coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, is not native to Florida (nor anywhere else in the continental United States). Its presence
                                in Palm Beach is due to the shipwreck of the Spanish ship Providencia in 1878, near Mar-a-Lago.
                                It was traveling from Havana to Cádiz, Spain with a cargo of coconuts harvested on the Caribbean
                                island of Trinidad.[7] Since the shipwreck was near the shore, the coconuts were salvaged,
                                and many were planted.[8][9] A lush grove of palm trees soon grew on what was later named
                                Palm Beach.[10]

                            <p>Prior to being established as a resort by Henry Morrison Flagler,[5] who made the Atlantic coast
                                barrier island accessible via his Florida East Coast Railway, Palm Beach was a sparsely populated
                                part of Lake Worth. The nucleus of the community was established by Flagler's two luxury
                                resort hotels, the Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel. West Palm Beach was built
                                across Lake Worth as a service town and has become a major city in its own right. Flagler's
                                house lots were bought by the beneficiaries of the Gilded Age, and in 1902 Flagler himself
                                built a Beaux-Arts mansion, Whitehall, designed by the New York–based firm Carrère and Hastings
                                and helped establish the Palm Beach winter "season" by constantly entertaining. The town
                                was incorporated on 17 April 1911. An area known as the Styx housed the people who built
                                up the island. Workers rented small houses from the landowners.</p>
