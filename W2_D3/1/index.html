    <p id="p2">Papua New Guinea is classified as a developing economy by the International Monetary Fund.[14] Strong growth in Papua
        New Guinea's mining and resource sector led to the country becoming the sixth fastest-growing economy in the world
        in 2011.[15] Growth was expected to slow once major resource projects came on line in 2015.[16] Mining remains a
        major economic factor, however.
