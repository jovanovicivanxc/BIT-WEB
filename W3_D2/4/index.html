    <h1>Sithonia</h1>
    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>Gulfs that surround the peninsula are the Singitic Gulf to the east and the Toronean Gulf to the west. The mountain Itamos
        or Dragoudelis is in the center of the peninsula. Amongst the many places in Sithonia is the ancient city, the castle
        and the church of Agios Athanasios in Toroni, the windmills in Sikia and the 16th century church in Nikiti. Porto
        Koufo, is the largest natural harbor in Greece, which is mentioned by Thucydides as "hollow harbor"; it appears to
        be the fishing spot in the area. South, from the harbors exit there is Kartalia, the most southern part of Sithonia,
        a very impressive area which puts its visitors under a spell with its rocky secluded beaches. The beaches of Azapiko,
        Tristinika, Korakas, Marathias, Kalamitsi, and Kriaritsi are in the area. All the villages cover the peninsula mainly
        in the central and the southern portions. In the middle of Sithonia peninsula, near the village of Neos Marmaras,
        is the holiday resort of Porto Carras; the place of the 2003 European Union leaders' Summit. The landscape is covered
        with vineyards, forests, grasslands, shrubland and mountains. Gulfs that surround the peninsula are the Singitic
        Gulf to the east and the Toronean Gulf to the west. The mountain Itamos or Dragoudelis is in the center of the peninsula.
